Our Hackathon features three distinct tracks for you to choose from. Whether you're interested in A, B or C, there's something here for everyone. You can focus on one track or challenge yourself by participating in multiple ones. Join us to innovate, collaborate, and make a real impact!

Each track presents challenges provided by local businesses, offering you the unique opportunity to develop AI solutions using real industry data. Your innovative solutions have the potential to benefit these businesses and make a significant impact.

## How to Start

1. Choose the track which interests you most
2. Choose if you want to join alone or in a team
3. If you want to join in a team: Join forces with others
4. Start Hacking

## Presentation of the Solution

We do not have quantitative metrics to evaluate your solutions. Nevertheless, it would be nice if you could present your solution on friday. This would first give the companies the chance to pick up on your great ideas. The winners per track will be crowned by all of us by vote.
